              At the age of 12, Mandamin committed to pursuing high-level basketball, a decision that led her to leave her home community. She received 13 scholarship offers from institutions in the United States and Canada, ultimately accepting a full-ride scholarship during the pandemic. She played for women's college basketball teams in Illinois, Kansas, and Texas. In the summer of 2023, Mandamin committed to the University of Manitoba Bisons, marking a return to Winnipeg, where she had moved in her teens to further her basketball career.
